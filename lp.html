<h2 id="lp">Linguistic Power</h2>
<p>We could argue that language is a generative force and by itself is neutral. It does not simply describes reality. It is world-building and actively constructs its own reality in the minds of users and listeners. It could be easily understood that language is a potential tool with leanings either in a liberating or a destructive way. The first forms virtues, the latter manipulates.</p>
<p>Language can be oral or written, however, it can envoke emotion and inspire empathy for people we have never met or even for people who never existed, like characters created by great novelists such as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky. It's not an exaggeration to say that he was the dissector of human soul with his penetrating and finely crafted portrayals of both the protagonists and side characters. John R. R. Tolkien went a step further with his high fantasy by creating a fictional universe inhabited by supernatural humanoid beings. Yet, as readers, we are still able to form images in our minds, making it feel real. As once Ludwig Wittgenstein very accurately stated and highlights the power of language:
<div id="quote"></div>
<script src="script.js"></script>
<p>Till now we examined scenarios of an enhanced version of reality. What happens though, when someone stops describing reality and starts replacing it? It is possible to use language as a mechanism for changing consiousness through everyday words and phrases. Then we have successfuly reached the so-called moral distance to potentially justify less ethical behavior. Let's dive into this idea with the following example and watch carefully how our perspective changes.

<div id="div1" style="text-align: center; font-family: monospace;" >
<span id="live">‚óèLIVE</span>Reports talk about <span id="term" class="fade-word">collateral damage</span> as the conflict escalates.
<script src="script2.js"></script>
</div>
<p>During modern military operations, we often read about collateral damage, making so awkard to understand it's about human lives.
